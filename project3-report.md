* monitoring of high-risk zones like workspaces and IT infrastructure areas
  + Access control points: Main entrance with biometric authentication for employees
* restricted areas such as server rooms, business and finance departments and executive offices having multifactor authentication
  + Safe zones: Emergency exits in case of security threats
    - Secure storage for sensitive documents
    - Panic rooms or safe spaces for employees during emergencies
* **Physical Barriers and Systems:**
  + Type of barriers: Physical barriers such as fencing and controlled entry points to prevent unauthorized access
    - Secure entrances with proper control access
  + Security systems (alarms, cameras): CCTV surveillance cameras which cover entry points, corridors, workspaces and server rooms
    - Emergency alarms such as fire alarms, intrusion detection systems and panic buttons in high risk zones
  + Access control mechanisms: employees having access only to certain places based on their roles
    - RFID based access for finance and IT departments
* **Visitor and Employee Access Policies:**
  + All the visitors must register at the reception and should be accompanied within premises by an authorized employee
  + Employees can only access areas which are relevant to their job function. Secure authentication for restricted zones

## 4. Cybersecurity Policies

* **Password Management:**
  + Requirements: A password should be 10 characters including both uppercase and lowercase as well as at least a number and special character
  + Change frequency: mandatorily change password in every 4 months and avoid reusing old passwords
* **User Roles and Access Levels:**
  + Role based access: Employees are assigned permissions only to places relevant for their job roles
  + Least privilege principle: Users and employees get access only to resources they need for their job or task nothing extra
* **Account Lifecycle Management:**
  + Provisioning process: Names of new employees are included in systems and databases and they receive role-based access and credentials after joining the organisation
  + Deprovisioning process: immediate revocation of access and credentials and removal of name of the employees from systems and databases as soon as the exit the organization

## 5. Monitoring and Response Plans

* **Monitoring Systems:**
  + Physical security: 24/7 CCTV surveillance cameras at entry points and protected areas
    - Intrusion detection for unauthorized access using motion sensors and alarm systems
  + Cybersecurity: Using tools like SIEM for real time monitoring of network traffic and system logs.
    - Ensuring endpoint security by installing antivirus software and firewall protection on employee devices and office equipments
* **Incident Response Plan:**
  + Physical breach: Take immediate action by activating emergency alarm system and notifying security personnel as well as other employees
    - Secure the affected areas and prevent any unauthorized action in those areas
    - Review CCTV footage and log books and records to find the main culprit behind this breach
  + Cyber breach: identify the threat by detecting the affected systems and categorize the breach
    - Temporarily disable compromised accounts, apply security methods and restore the data through backups
    - Post incident analysis conduct digital forensic investigation and update cybersecurity protocols
* **Communication Plan:** Automate internal alert systems such as emails/ SMS alerts for urgent security threats
* Have dedicated security personnels or crisis handling teams to handle such physical and cyber incidents
* Have compliance with data protection laws and proper communication with the customers who have been affected by such incidents

  + General awareness training is conducted quarterly for all employees
  + Advanced security training is conducted for IT and finance teams once in every year
* **Drills and Exercises:**
  + **Types:**
  + Physical security drills which involves emergency evacuation practises in case of fire or security breach
  + Cyber incident simulation which educates us about cyber incidents through phishing attack scenarios and real time cyberattack response exercises
  + **Schedule:** Fire safety and intrusion response drills are conducted in every 6 months
  + Live threat simulations to test response readiness and other cybersecurity exercises are conducted in every 6 months

## 7. Maintenance and Review

* **Review Schedule:** Conducting quarterly assessments for physical security systems and physical barriers to ensure their proper functionality
* Perform monthly audits for cybersecurity systems and network vulnerabilities
* **Maintenance Routines:**
  + Physical security systems: Regular inspection of CCTV cameras, biometric sensors and ID verification tools to prevent hardware failure
  + Cybersecurity systems:
  + Ensuring all security software and cloud-based systems are updated regularly to mitigate emerging threats
  + Conduct quarterly audits of user permission to revoke unnecessary access
