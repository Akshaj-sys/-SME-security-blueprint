**4. Cybersecurity Policies**

* **Password Management:**
  + **Requirements:** A password should be 10 characters including both uppercase and lowercase as well as at least a number and special character
  + **Change frequency:** mandatorily change password in every 4 months and avoid reusing old passwords
* **User Roles and Access Levels:**
  + **Role based access:** Employees are assigned permissions only to places relevant for their job roles
  + **Least privilege principle:** Users and employees get access only to resources they need for their job or task nothing extra
* **Account Lifecycle Management:**
  + **Provisioning process:** Names of new employees are included in systems and databases and they receive role-based access and credentials after joining the organisation

    - Ensuring endpoint security by installing antivirus software and firewall protection on employee devices and office equipments
* **Incident Response Plan:**
  + **Physical breach:** Take immediate action by activating emergency alarm system and notifying security personnel as well as other employees
    - Secure the affected areas and prevent any unauthorized action in those areas
    - Review CCTV footage and log books and records to find the main culprit behind this breach
  + **Cyber breach:** identify the threat by detecting the affected systems and categorize the breach
    - Temporarily disable compromised accounts, apply security methods and restore the data through backups
    - Post incident analysis conduct digital forensic investigation and update cybersecurity protocols
* **Communication Plan:** Automate internal alert systems such as emails/ SMS alerts for urgent security threats
